	 * @brief The Singleton class template provides a way to create a singleton instance of a class.
	 * It ensures that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application.
	 * The instance is created on first access and is destroyed when the application exits.
	 * 
	 * @tparam T The type of the singleton class.
	 * 
	 * @note This Singleton is thread-safe and supports nothrow default construction. It is designed with C++17 and CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) in mind.
	 * 
	 * @see https://github.com/jimmy-park/singleton?tab=readme-ov-file
